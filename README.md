# simple_compiler
####THIS IS SIMPLE COMPILER (MODIFIED ASM) USING C LANG.<br />
####THIS COMPILER WILL BE USED AS COMPILER OF HOME MADE 16 BIT COMPILER (MACHINE CODE DOESN'T SHOWN HERE) <br />
####THIS COMPILER IDEA IS TAKEN FROM CODEWARS ASSEMBLER 2 KATA <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/assembler-interpreter-part-ii"> KATA </a><br />
####IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES PLEASE CONTACT WITH ME <br />
####THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING <br />
#USED SYNTAX (CASE SENSITIVE)<br />
## AU SECTION
### MOV A, B
###### THIS COPIES THE VALUE OF B TO A
###### IF A DOESN'T EXISTS IT WILL CREATE REGISTER A
###### B CAN BE EITHER A NUMBER OR A EXISTANT REGISTER
### ADD A, B
###### THIS ADDS THE VALUE OF B FROM A AND SAVES THE RESULT IN A
###### A MUST BE EXISTANT REGISTER, B CAN BE EITHER NUMBER OR EXISTANT REGISTER
### SUB A, B
###### THIS SUBTRACTS THE VALUE OF B FROM A AND SAVES THE RESULT IN A
###### A MUST BE EXISTANT REGISTER, B CAN BE EITHER NUMBER OR EXISTANT REGISTER
### MUL A, B
###### THIS DIVIDES THE VALUE OF B FROM A AND SAVES THE RESULT IN A
###### A MUST BE EXISTANT REGISTER, B CAN BE EITHER NUMBER OR EXISTANT REGISTER
### DIV A, B
###### THIS DIV THE VALUE OF (EITHER REGISTER OR NUMBER) B TO THE VALUE OF REGISTER A (MUST BE EXISTED SOMEWHERE) AND SAVES THE DIVISION IN REGISTER A <br />
### INC A
###### THIS INC THE VALUE OF REGISTER A BY ONE AND SAVES THE RESULT IN A
### DEC A
###### THIS DEC THE VALUE OF REGISTER A BY ONE AND SAVES THE RESULT IN A
### CMP A, B
###### THIS COMPARES A AND B AND RETURNS EITHER EQUAL OR LESSTHAN OR GREATER THAN
###### A, B CAN BE AN EXISTANT REGISTERS OR A NUMBERS
### LABEL :
###### THIS MAKES A LABEL WHICH YOU CAN JUMP TO IN YOUR CODE
## JUMPS SECTION
### JMP LABEL
###### THIS GOES TO THE LINE AT WHICH THE LABEL DEFINED
### JE LABEL
###### THIS JUMPS TO THE LABEL IF THE LAST CMP RESULT IS EQUAL
### JNE LABEL
###### THIS JUMPS TO THE LABEL IF THE LAST CMP RESULT IS NOT EQUAL (EITHER GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN)
### JG LABEL
###### THIS JUMPS TO THE LABEL IF THE LAST CMP RESULT IS GREATER THAN
### JGE LABEL
###### THIS JUMPS TO THE LABEL IF THE LAST CMP RESULT IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL
### JL LABEL
###### THIS JUMPS TO THE LABEL IF THE LAST CMP RESULT IS LESS THAN
### JLE LABEL
###### THIS JUMPS TO THE LABEL IF THE LAST CMP RESULT IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL
## CALL LABEL (AKA FUNCTION)
###### THIS SPECIAL JMP WHEN USED IT CALLS THE LABEL BUT THIS LABEL MUST HAVE RET STATEMENT TO RETURN TO THE CALL LINE
## RET
###### THIS RETURNS TO THE LINE WHICH THE LABEL CALLED FROM
## END
###### THIS ENDS (TERMINATES) THE PROGRAM
